      <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
      <p>I am a <strong>Research Scientist II</strong> with experience in <strong>Deep Learning</strong> and <strong>DLOps</strong>. I am currently leading a research team under the guidance of senior doctors and scientists at the Department of Trauma and Emergency, AIIMS Raipur, Chhattisgarh. We are working on the Intelligent Emergency Healthcare System project, which focuses on developing advanced critical care tools for remote and underserved hospitals. My core research involves real-time ECG data analysis to enable early cardiovascular disease detection. This system is designed to assist doctors by delivering instant diagnostic insights during emergencies, helping improve clinical decisions and patient outcomes.</p>
      <p>Previously, I contributed to urban planning and GeoInformatics research, working on projects like building usage type classification in Indian cities and predicting Women‚Äôs Crime hotspots. My work is driven by a strong foundation in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, applied across diverse, real-world challenges.</p>
